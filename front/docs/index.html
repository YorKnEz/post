            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                Realize a Web application for translating poems commented by multiple users. Translation for the poem or
                a
                fragment of it may be provided with the afferent annotation. The system will support lyric annotation
                with the
                possibility of sharing on social platforms like Tumblr or WordPress, based on the public APIs.
                Statistics will
                be provided regarding the activity on the platform (e.g. the most active translator, the most annotated
                poem,
                ...). The new translations will be exposed on an RSS flux. The essential functionalities will be
                provided by our
                own API, built based on the architectural styles of REST or GraphQL.

                <p>
                    The regular user is the average user that uses the application. He can contribute to lyrics by
                    editing them
                    and annotationg them, but he requires the approval of an admin.

                <p>
                    The poet is a special kind of user that has the ability to do whatever he wants without requesting
                    permission to any piece of content that is his own.

                    The admin is the one that approves the requests of the regular users and, in general, handles
                    moderation of
                    the application. He can approve poets on the app, new poems, new annotations, edits, etc.

                The main limitation of this product is the fact that we are not allowed to use any frameworks for this
                project,
                everything must be done from scratch. At the same time, there is no guarantee that the pages of the app
                are 100%
                compatbile with other browsers than Firefox.

                    Since our application includes multiple pages, the need of a navigation tool is mandatory. As such,
                    our app includes a navbar and a sidebar which contain a few useful links in order to make navigation
                    easier. At the same time, they include a few buttons such as a theme changer and a link to our RSS
                    flux.
                    The sidebar contains the useful links and will include the search and icons from the navbar on lower
                    screen widths. The navbar is for quicker search and access to some functionalities.
                    The full list of features included in the navbar are:
