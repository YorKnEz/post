    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <section id="purpose">
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Realize a Web application for translating poems commented by multiple users. Translation for the poem or a
        fragment of it may be provided with the afferent annotation. The system will support lyric annotation with the
        possibility of sharing on social platforms like Tumblr or WordPress, based on the public APIs. Statistics will
        be provided regarding the activity on the platform (e.g. the most active translator, the most annotated poem,
        ...). The new translations will be exposed on an RSS flux. The essential functionalities will be provided by our
        own API, built based on the architectural styles of REST or GraphQL.

      <h3>User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
      <p>
        There will be three types of users which were already sketched in the <a href="#functions">Product functions</a>
        section:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular</li>
        <li>Poet</li>
        <li>Admin</li>
      </ul>
      <section id="regular-user">
        <h4>Regular</h4>
        <p>
          The regular user is the average user that uses the application. He can contribute to lyrics by editing them
          and annotationg them, but he requires the approval of an admin.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="poet-user">
        <h4>Poet</h4>
        <p>
          The poet is a special kind of user that has the abillity to do whatever he wants without requesting
          permission to any piece of content that is his own.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="admin-user">
        <h4>Admin</h4>
        <p>
          The admin is the one that approves the requests of the regular users and, in general, handles moderation of
          the application. He can approve poets on the app, new poems, new annotations, edits, etc.

    <section id="environment">
      <h3>Operating Environment</h3>
      <p>
        The app has been extensively tested only on Firefox browser. It may be used on other browsers as well but we do
        not guarantee 100% compatibility.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="constraints">
      <h3>Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
      <p>
        The main limitation of this product is the fact that we are not allowed to use any frameworks for this project,
        everything must be done from scratch. At the same time, there is no guarantee that the pages of the app are 100%
        compatbile with other browsers than Firefox.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="user-docs">
      <h3>User Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        We do not provide any kind of user documentation. Our application is designed to be easy to use and intuitive
        and, as such, we do not see the need for a user manual or any other document of that type.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="dependencies">
      <h3>Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        We will use APIs of social media apps in order to provide the share feature.

        sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout
        constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts,
        error
        message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed.
        Details
        of
        the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.
